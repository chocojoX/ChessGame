## Features to add

- Pieces basic movements
- Special moves : Castling, En-passant, Promotion
- Display board in ascii + Interactive keyboard move input with standard notations
- Test that all rules of chess are respected by the program
- Create a random AI
- Create a naive min-max AI
- Add pruning to the min-max algorithm
- Add mouse-interactive display using cv2
- Add time management to the game and to the AI


If I am really motivated, I may consider training a neural network to play, but this will require a lot more work so it'll certainly have to wait :)
